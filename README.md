# SORMAS Issuetracker

This issuetracker is supposed to automatically fetch issue data from the [SORMAS](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project) repository.

Issue Progress ratings are based on the issues position in project boards.

If the Issue description contains a section starting with "### Issuetracker Description", everything following this section will be used to build the description.
Else, the entire Issue-Description is pulled.

You can try out the current version of the development-branch here: https://seal33.github.io/sormas-issuetracker/issuetracker

Please note that this is very much WIP!
